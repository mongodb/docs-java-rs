The examples in this guide use the ``Subscriber`` implementations described in
the :ref:`Quick Start Primer <javars-primer>`. The {+driver-short+} extends the
Java Reactive Streams API, which consists of the following components:

.. TODO:
.. Change link from quick start primer to get started page instead of quick start primer

* Publisher

* Subscriber

* Subscription

.. TODO: change LINK HERE to link with information about publishers and subscribers.

.. To learn more about how these components work and how to create your own
   Subscriber implementations, see LINK HERE.
