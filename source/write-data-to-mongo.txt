Overview
--------

This page contains copyable code examples of {+driver-short+} methods that you can use to
write data to MongoDB.

.. tip::

  To learn more about any of the methods shown on this page, see the link
  provided in each section.

To use an example from this page, copy the code example into the
:ref:`sample application <java-rs-write-sample>` or your own application.
Be sure to replace all placeholders in the code examples, such as ``<connection string>``, with
the relevant values for your MongoDB deployment.

.. important:: Project Reactor Library

   This guide uses the Project Reactor library to implement ``Publisher`` and
   ``Subscriber`` methods. To learn more about the Project Reactor library and how
   to use it, see `Getting Started
   <https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#getting-started>`__
   in the Reactor documentation.

In {+java-rs+}, all operations that return a ``Publisher`` do not execute
unless you subscribe to the returned ``Publisher`` method. This guide uses the
``Mono.block()`` method to subscribe to a ``Publisher`` and block the
``Publisher`` until it reaches its terminal state. To learn more
about {+java-rs+}, see `Reactive Streams <https://www.reactive-streams.org/>`__
in the {+java-rs+} documentation.
