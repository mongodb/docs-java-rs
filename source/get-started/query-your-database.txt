Query your Database
====================

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

    .. step:: Create your Query Application
      
      Within the same Maven or Gradle project you used in the
      :ref:`previous step <java-rs-get-started-create-deployment>`,
      create a folder named ``org.query``. In the ``org.query`` folder, create a Java
      file named ``QueryDatabase``. Copy and paste the following code into the
      ``QueryDatabase`` file.


      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/query-database.java
         :language: java
         :copyable:

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string URI>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`java-rs-get-started-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Application

      Run your application, either in your IDE or in your shell. 
      The output includes details of the retrieved movie document:

      .. code-block:: none

         {
           _id: ...,
           plot: 'A young man is accidentally sent 30 years into the past...',
           genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi' ],
           ...
           title: 'Back to the Future',
           ...
         }

      .. tip::

         If you encounter an error or see no output, check whether you specified the
         proper connection string, and that you loaded the
         sample data. The ``Logging is disabled`` error is standard and does not
         block your query.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, queries the deployment
and prints out the result.
