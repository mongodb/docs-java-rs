    .. step:: Implement Reactive Streams Subscribers

      Create a folder within the Java folder in your Maven or Gradle project named ``helpers``.
      In the ``helpers`` folder, create a Java file named ``SubscriberHelpers``. The
      Java Reactive Streams driver is an implementation of the Reactive
      Streams API, which consists of three components: publisher, subscriber,
      and subscription. The following code is our implementation of six
      different ``Subscriber`` types used in your {+driver-short+} application. 

    .. LA LA LA

      Copy and paste the following code 
      into the ``SubscriberHelpers`` file:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/subscriber-helpers.java
         :language: java
         :copyable:

   .. step:: Create your {+driver-short+} Application
      
      Create a folder within the Java folder in your Maven or Gradle project named ``org.example``.
      In the ``org.example`` folder, create a Java file named ``QuickStart``. Copy and paste the following code 
      into the ``QuickStart`` file:
      
      .. literalinclude:: /includes/get-started/connect-and-ping.java
         :language: java
         :copyable:

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      Replace the ``<connection string URI>`` placeholder with the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`java-rs-get-started-connection-string`
      step of this guide.

   .. step:: Run your Application

      Run your application, either in your IDE or in your shell. The output
      shows that you have connected to MongoDB.

      .. code-block:: none

        Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!

      .. tip::

         If you encounter an error, check whether you specified the
         proper connection string. The ``Logging is disabled`` error 
         is standard and does not block your query.

After you complete these steps, you have a working application that
uses the driver to connect to your MongoDB deployment, pings the deployment,
and prints out the result.
