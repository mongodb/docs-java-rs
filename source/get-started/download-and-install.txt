   .. step:: Install Dependencies
    
      Ensure you have `JDK version 8 or later
      <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__ installed
      in your development environment.

      This guide shows you how to add the MongoDB Java driver dependencies using 
      Maven or Gradle in an integrated development environment (IDE). We
      recommend that you use an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE. An IDE
      makes it more convenient to configure Maven or Gradle to build and run
      your project.

      If you are not using an IDE, see
      `Building Maven <https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-building-maven.html>`_
      or
      `Creating New Gradle Builds
      <https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/>`_
      for more information about how to set up your project.

   .. step:: Install {+driver-short+}

      Open a new Maven or Gradle project in your IDE. 

      If you are using `Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__, add the following to
      your ``pom.xml`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: xml

        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
                <artifactId>mongodb-driver-reactivestreams</artifactId>
                <version>{+full-version+}</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>

      If you are using `Gradle <https://gradle.org/>`__, add the following to your
      ``build.gradle`` dependencies list:

      .. code-block:: groovy
        
          dependencies {
            implementation 'org.mongodb:mongodb-driver-reactivestreams:{+full-version+}'
          }
      
      Once you configure your dependencies, ensure they are available to your
      project by running your dependency manager and refreshing
      the project in your IDE.
      
After you complete these steps, you have a new project 
and the driver dependencies installed.
